  //Example: If the month starts on a Wednesday (index 3), then firstDayIndex = 3, so we need 3 days from the previous month.

  // Current month's days
  //const currentMonth = Array.from({ length: daysInMonth }, (_, i) => i + 1);

  // Next month's days (fill remaining slots to complete 6-row grid)
  //const totalDays = 42; // Ensures a full 6-row grid (7x6 = 42)
