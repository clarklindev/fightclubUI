```jsx
import { ToggleButton } from '@/components';

enum ToggleEnumWithMaybe {
    ON = 'true',
    OFF = 'false',
    MAYBE = 'maybe',
}

/*
Technically, a toggle is a behavior not a component, you are describing an action, the visual result is because
of the state change and the driver behind a toggle is a useToggleHook. This way, the implementation is loosely
tied to the visual representation of the state.

A toggle usually has 2 states (depending on usage case), on/off; active/inactive etc and thats okay and for most
situations, but lets open up to the idea where there is a possibility for more than 2 states (an arbitary amount
of states) a toggle function should then have the ability to toggle all the states. This is possible with the
use of an enum and combined with 'smart' coding, you can loop the different values of an enum. By isolating the
amount of values in the enum, we can implement the basic toggle (and toggle more than 2 states if needed)

<ToggleButton
    enumObj={ToggleEnumWithMaybe}
    render={current => {
        switch (current) {
            case 'ON':
                return (
                <Icon size="L">
                    <HeartIcon />
                </Icon>
                );

            case 'OFF':
                return <Icon size="L">OFF</Icon>;

            case 'MAYBE':
            default:
                return <Icon size="L">'maybe'</Icon>;
        }
    }}
/>
